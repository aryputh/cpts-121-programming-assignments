## cpts 121 programming assignments
All of my programming assignments for my CptS 121 course. Basic description of each PA is available in this file.

### Programming Assignment 1 - Solving Equations
Create a program that evaluates the equations listed below. Checking for faulty numbers aren't required.
1. Newton’s Second Law of Motion: force = mass * acceleration
2. Volume of a cylinder: volume_cylinder = PI * radius^2 * height
3. Character encoding: encoded_character = (plaintext_character - 'a') + 'A
4. Gravity: force = G * mass1 * mass2 / distance^2
5. Resistive divider: vout = r2 / (r1 + r2) * vin
6. Distance between two points: distance = √((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)
7. General equation: y = (73 / 12) - x * z + a / (a % 2)

### Programming Assignment 2 - Solving Equations using Files
Alter PA 1 to be modular and use scanning for inputs. Do not check for faulty inputs.
1. Newton’s Second Law of Motion: force = mass * acceleration
2. Volume of a cylinder: volume_cylinder = PI * radius^2 * height
3. Character encoding: encoded_character = (plaintext_character - 'a') + 'A
4. Gravity: force = G * mass1 * mass2 / distance^2
5. Resistive divider: vout = r2 / (r1 + r2) * vin
6. Distance between two points: distance = √((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)
7. General equation: y = (73 / 12) - x * z + a / (a % 2)
